          So, you wanna know what’s a bullet journal, do you? Maybe you’ve
          already seen lots of cool bullet journal ideas on Pinterest, or even
          checked out some YouTube videos, but you’re still not quite sure how
          to bullet journal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          Or maybe you’re sitting there scratching your head going, “What’s
          bullet journal, book to track your ammo?”
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          Don’t worry! Lucky for you, I’ve set up this nifty and thorough bullet
          journal guide to explain everything you could possibly be wondering
          about it.
        </p>

        <h2>What is a bullet journal?</h2>

        <img
          src="/images/bullet-journal.jpg"
          class="post-img-1"
          alt="bullet-yournal"
        />

        <br />
        <blockquote>
          In the words of bullet journal creator Ryder Carroll, the bullet
          journal is a “mindfulness practice disguised as a productivity
          system.”
        </blockquote>
        <p class="content">
          My simpler bullet journal definition is this: it’s a notebook that
          keeps you organized using a special system.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          The notebook part is simple (use whatever you want), but the system
          part is what throws people off.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          I, like many others before me, found jargon such as Future Log,
          Signifiers, and Migration to be utterly perplexing. After much
          reading, I realized that the system is actually simple, practical, and
          yes – it works.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          If you like writing with pen and paper, like making to-do lists, want
          to improve your habits, or want to get better at not wasting time, a
          bullet journal will be worth it for you!
        </p>

          check out my bullet journal glossary post. It’s an explainer that
          should help you understand the terms and abbreviations commonly used
          in the planner community.

        <h2>How To Bullet Journal In 5 Easy Steps</h2>

        <p class="content">
          Before you start a bullet journal, you’re gonna need to create a kind
          of framework. This framework is what makes the bullet journal method
          work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The bullet journal method is made up of several different modules:
        </p>

        <ol class="list">
          <li>a table of contents <span>(the Index Page)</span></li>

          <li>a yearly overview <span>(the Future Log)</span></li>

          <li>monthly overview pages <span>(Monthly Logs)</span></li>

          <li>
            weekly or daily overview pages <span>(Weekly and Daily Logs)</span>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Step One – Index Page</h3>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="/images/bullet-journal-index-example.png"
            class="post-img-2"
            alt="bullet-journal-index"
          />
          <figcaption>
            This is the what the official bullet journal index pages look like.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="content">
          As mentioned above, the bullet journal index page is like a table of
          contents, helping you keep track of where things are located in your
          notebook. In order do to this, you’ll first need to number the pages
          in your journal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          Once you’ve got numbered pages, you can designate a page or two to use
          as your index. In the same way that books usually put the table of
          contents right at the front, most bullet journalers put their index on
          the first page or two of their journal.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content">
          You don’t need to do anything too fancy here for now, just maybe write
          the word “Index” as a header. Later, you’ll fill in this area with the
          important topics in your journal and what page to find them on.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="content">Pretty spiffy, eh?</p>

        <h3>Step Two – Future Log</h3>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="/images/2019-bullet-journal-future-log-year-at-a-glance-layout-example.png"
            class="post-img-3"
            alt="bullet-journal-future-log"
          />
          <figcaption>
            I messed up some of the calendars in this future log… whoops!
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p class="content">
          The Future Log gives you an overview of the year ahead. Like a
          calendar.
        </p>

        <p class="content">
          So in your Future Log you’ll write down all the birthdays, events,
          appointments, and other important dates coming in the months ahead.
        </p>

        <h4>Here’s another future log example:</h4>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="/images/2019-bullet-journal-future-log-year-at-a-glance-layout-example.png"
            class="post-img-4"
            alt="bullet-journal-future-log"
          />
          <figcaption>
            I messed up some of the calendars in this future log… whoops!
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Now, you must be wondering, what comes after the future log? I’ll tell
          you.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>It’s your first monthly log. Yay!</p>

        <h3>Step Three – Monthly Log</h3>

        <p>The Monthly Log gives you a big-picture view of the month ahead.</p>

        <p>
          A monthly calendar spread is where you can write down all the
          happenings, events, birthdays, goals, monthly tasks, etc.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          You’ll create a new monthly log at the start of each month. If you’re
          setting up your bullet journal for the first time, during the middle
          of the month, just make a monthly log for the current month.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The basic set up for the monthly log is to use two facing pages.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On one side, you can put a calendar page. Some people put a list of
          all the days of the month, some prefer to make a calendar grid. You do
          you.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once you’ve created the calendar, just log your upcoming events. You
          can also add them in as they occur later.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On the facing page, list your goals, objectives, monthly tasks. I like
          to write down any holidays and special awareness themes for the month
          here as well.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          As you can see if you’ve been following along with these steps, making
          a bullet journal is not that hard. There’s one more special page to
          set up.
        </p>

        <h3>Step Four – Weekly Log</h3>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="/images/how-to-bullet-journal-weekly-spread-example.png"
            class="post-img-4"
            alt="weekly-spread"
          />
          <figcaption>A simple bullet journal weekly spread.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          Okay, so weekly logs were not originally included in the official
          bullet journal set up.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>BUT from what I see, most bullet journalers make them.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          It’s useful to see what you’ve got going on for the rest of the week,
          and to see how far away you are from the weekend, is it not?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To make a weekly log, you can either use a single page, or two facing
          pages. I recommend starting out with two facing pages. If you find
          that you still have plenty of blank space after a week, you can cut
          back to using only one page for the next week.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          All you need to do here is write out the days of the week, equally
          spaced. The typical weekly spread layout is some kind of grid. In the
          above example I wanted to keep it simple-looking by using only
          horizontal lines.
        </p>

        <h3>Step Five – Daily Log</h3>

        <p>
          Daily logs are the bread and butter of bullet journaling. This is
          where you’ll keep a running list of tasks, events, and notes for the
          day. It’s kind of like a daily to-do list, but where you also log
          things you want to remember.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For example, if you have any appointments, meetings, classes, or
          things you need to get done for the day, write them in your daily log.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The daily log is also a good place to keep track of what happened
          during the day. If you want to track your water intake, you can write
          down how many glasses of water you drank. You can log your exercise,
          reading, what you ate, or any other things you did.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          If you’re using a weekly log, you can just do your daily logging in
          the areas you already wrote out for each day.
